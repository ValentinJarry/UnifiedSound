/**
 * ## Musical Commas Summary
 *
 * This section explains the differences between various types of musical commas: tonic comma, schisma, septimal comma, and diatonic comma.
 *
 * ### 1. Tonic Comma
 * - **Definition**: The tonic comma (often the syntonic comma) is the difference between a just major third (5:4) and four pure fifths (3:2).
 * - **Value**: Approximately 21.51 cents.
 * - **Significance**: Highlights the discrepancy between just intonation and meantone temperament.
 *
 * ### 2. Schisma
 * - **Definition**: The schisma is the difference between the Pythagorean comma and the syntonic comma.
 * - **Value**: Approximately 1.95 cents.
 * - **Significance**: A very small, mostly theoretical interval used in mathematical tuning systems.
 *
 * ### 3. Septimal Comma
 * - **Definition**: A comma related to intervals involving the 7th harmonic, such as the difference between the 7:4 harmonic and a tempered interval.
 * - **Value**: Approximately 27.26 cents.
 * - **Significance**: Appears in extended just intonation and microtonal music.
 *
 * ### 4. Diatonic Comma
 * - **Definition**: A less common term, potentially referring to discrepancies in diatonic scale intervals in different tuning systems.
 * - **Value**: Varies based on context and tuning system.
 * - **Significance**: Describes small differences in diatonic scale intervals but is rarely used in formal contexts.

 * | **Comma Type**     | **Definition**                             | **Value (Approx.)** | **Context**                                         |
 * |---------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
 * | **Tonic Comma**     | Difference between 5:4 and 3:2^4          | 21.51 cents         | Just intonation vs. meantone temperament          |
 * | **Schisma**         | Difference between Pythagorean and syntonic commas | 1.95 cents         | Purely theoretical, rarely audible                |
 * | **Septimal Comma**  | Related to harmonics involving 7:4         | ~27 cents           | Microtonal and extended just intonation systems   |
 * | **Diatonic Comma**  | Discrepancies in diatonic scale intervals  | Context-dependent   | Rarely used, context varies with tuning systems   |
